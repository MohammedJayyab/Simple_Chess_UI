# WPF Chessboard UI – Project Specification

## 1. Objective

Develop a user interface (UI) for a chessboard application using **C# and WPF**, with accurate visual representation and valid move rule enforcement.  
**Note:** No chess engine or AI opponent should be included.

---

## 2. Technology Stack

- **Programming Language**: C#
- **Framework**: Windows Presentation Foundation (WPF)

---

## 3. UI Elements

1. **Chessboard**
   - Visual 8x8 grid.
2. **Squares**
   - Clearly defined.
   - Labeled using standard chess notation (a–h, 1–8).
3. **Chess Pieces**
   - Represented via images (you can use @images folder) or vector graphics.

---

## 4. Functionality

1. **Move Validation**
   - Enforce standard chess rules for all moves.
2. **User Interaction**
   - Users can select and move pieces.
3. **No AI**
   - Focus purely on UI and rule validation.

## 5. Detailed Specifications

### 5.1 Chessboard Representation

- Create a WPF control to represent the chessboard.
- Use layout controls like `Grid` or `ItemsControl`.
- Label each square using standard notation (e.g., a1–h8).
- Alternate light and dark squares visually.

### 5.2 Piece Representation

- Use images or vector graphics for pieces.
- Each piece is associated with its current square.

### 5.3 Move Validation

- Implement logic for:
  - Legal piece movement.
  - Turn order.
  - Blocked paths (where applicable).
- Handle special cases:
  - Pawn moves and promotions.
  - Castling.
  - Check, checkmate, stalemate (basic detection).
- No AI or opponent behavior needed.

### 5.4 User Interaction

- Allow users to select a piece by clicking.
- Highlight valid moves.
- Move pieces by clicking a valid target square.
- Update board state after each move.

## 6. Code Structure

- **Architecture**: MVVM (Model-View-ViewModel)
- **Models**:
  - Chessboard
  - Square
  - Piece
- **Interfaces**:
  - Move validation
  - User interaction handling

---

## 7. UI/UX Considerations

- Intuitive, easy-to-use interface.
- Visual feedback during selection and movement.
- Accessibility support (where applicable).

---

## 8. Deliverables

- Complete WPF project source code.
- Documentation covering:
  - Architecture
  - Class/function overviews
  - Move validation logic

---

## 9. Success Criteria

- Application renders a functional 8x8 chessboard.
- Validates moves according to standard chess rules.
- UI is responsive, intuitive, and interactive.
